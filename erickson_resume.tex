  \section*{Employment}
  \begin{description}
    \item[Assistant Research Scientist]
    \emph{Labs of Drs. Fabio Piano and Kris Gunsalus, New York University
    (2009-2016)}

    Engineered Django interfaces (from database design to front-end
    design) to record, analyze, and present data for genomics research projects,
    totaling millions of experiments, and requiring cleaning years of
    poorly organized data and legacy code.
    See code, schemas, and screenshots at \website.

    Also assisted with experiment design, benchwork, and biological analysis of
    genome-scale screen using pairwise gene knockdowns to uncover
    genetic interactions in \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans} early embryogenesis.

    \item[Client Service Coordinator]
    \emph{H\&R Block, Washington, DC (2009)}

    Sole secretary and receptionist for a large office during tax season.
    Managed 6 phone lines, scheduled appointments, processed tax returns,
    addressed clients' issues, proctored exams, and earned tax preparation
    certificate.

    \item[Deli Manager and Cook]
    \emph{Sticky Fingers Bakery, Washington, DC (2007-2008)}

    Managed deli production and inventory, developed recipes,
    and cooked at an all-vegan bakery.

    \item[Research Technician and Assistant]
    \emph{Lab of Dr. Taylor Allen, Oberlin College Biology Department
        (2005-2007)}

    Mapped and characterized suppressor mutations to reveal interactions
    within and between muscle proteins in \emph{C. elegans}.
    Wrote honors thesis about the project,
    and presented findings at international scientific meetings.

    \item[Prior Job Experience]
    Support Staff at home for women with schizophrenia.
    Dietary Aide and dishwasher at assisted living home.
    Many years of early morning newspaper delivery.

  \section*{Other Experiences}
  \begin{description}
      \item[Bicycle Touring]
      Organized and conducted self-supported tours
      coast-to-coast across the United States,
      along the Mississippi River,
      circumnavigating Lake Superior,
      across Scandinavia,
      and from Portland to San Francisco.

      \item[Steel Drums]
      Competed with 100-member steel drum band in five NYC Panorama
      competitions (3 wins). Played and toured with Oberlin's student-run
      steel drum band, and taught a course for college and high school
      students.

      \item[Wildlife Conservation]
      Built websites for a birder's conservation efforts.
      Documented roadkill on cross-country trip to encourage responsible
      driving. Helped rehab birds and small mammals throughout childhood.

      \item[Food Coops]
      As member of Oberlin Student Cooperative Organization,
      mediated 60-person discussions as
      Discussion and Loose Ends Coordinator; served as
      Treasurer, bread baker, and pizza maker; and survived
      four years in the vegan, no-sugar, at-least-half-whole-wheat coop.
      Current member of the Park Slope Food Coop.
